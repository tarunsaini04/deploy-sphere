🚀 DeploySphere
A Personal Cloud Deployment Platform

DeploySphere is a deployment pipeline built from scratch with Node.js and React.
It demonstrates a deep understanding of system design and backend engineering by creating a fully automated system that:

📂 Clones a GitHub repository 
⚙️ Builds the project 
☁️ Deploys static assets to a cloud object store 
🌐 Serves them on the local machine via custom subdomains 


🏛️ Architecture & System Design
DeploySphere follows a decoupled microservices architecture powered by Redis as a central message broker.

🔑 Core Components

->API Gateway (upload-service) → Handles requests, validates input, queues jobs
->Message Broker (Redis) → Manages build-queue & deployment status
->Build Worker (deploy-service) → CI/CD pipeline executor (clone → build → deploy)
->Reverse Proxy (request-handler) → Serves deployed projects via subdomains

📌 Result → Resilient, scalable, and async system that mimics real-world cloud deployment platforms.


✨ Key Features

✅ Microservices architecture (Upload, Deploy, Request Handler, Frontend)
✅ Asynchronous job queue with Redis
✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline (clone → build → deploy)
✅ Cloud storage integration with Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)
✅ Dynamic subdomain routing (project-id.localhost)
✅ Real-time deployment status in the React frontend


🛠️ Tech Stack

Layer			            Technology
Backend		    Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
Frontend	    React, Vite, CSS
Queueing	    Redis
Cloud		      Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)
Core Libs	    aws-sdk, simple-git, redis, dotenv, cors


⚙️ Deployment Lifecycle

1. Submission (Frontend → Upload Service)
	User submits GitHub repo → generates unique ID → uploaded to R2 → job pushed to Redis queue.

2. Build (Deploy Service)
	Worker picks job → installs deps → builds project → uploads build to R2.

3. Serve (Request Handler)
	Reverse proxy maps subdomain → fetches files from R2 → serves static assets.


🚀 Running the Project Locally

📋 Prerequisites
   ->Node.js (v20+ recommended)
   ->npm
   ->Redis (local or via Docker)
   ->Cloudflare R2 credentials

🔧 Setup Instructions
   # Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deploy-sphere.git
   cd deploy-sphere

   # Install dependencies for all services
   cd upload-service && npm install && cd ..
   cd deploy-service && npm install && cd ..
   cd request-handler && npm install && cd ..
   cd vercel-frontend && npm install && cd ..


⚙️ Environment Variables
   Each backend service (upload-service, deploy-service, request-handler) needs a .env file.

   R2_ACCESS_KEY=your-key
   R2_SECRET_KEY=your-secret
   R2_BUCKET=your-bucket


🖥️ Modify Hosts File
   Map project subdomains to localhost:
   127.0.0.1 my-test-project.localhost

▶️ Start Services
   # Run each service in a separate terminal
   npm run dev  # inside upload-service
   npm run dev  # inside deploy-service
   npm run dev  # inside request-handler
   npm run dev  # inside vercel-frontend


🎉 Then open http://localhost:5173, paste a GitHub repo link, and hit Deploy! 


💡 Challenges & Learnings
System Design → Redis as message broker enabled true async processing.
S3 Key Consistency → Fixed NoSuchKey by aligning deploy & request-handler logic.
Async Ops → Switched from forEach to for...of for proper async/await handling.
